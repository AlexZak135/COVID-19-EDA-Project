# COVID-19-EDA-Project

## Background
In late 2019, cases of severe respiratory illness caused by a new type of coronavirus were reported in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province in China. The disease is now commonly referred to as COVID-19. By January 2020, the virus had spread beyond China's borders, and the number of COVID-19 cases began to rise worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on everyone's life across the globe. This global crisis has made social distancing and wearing face masks in public the new norm.

## Research Focus and Data Overview
The objective of this exploratory data analysis was to obtain a comprehensive understanding of various COVID metrics in the National Capital Region of the Washington metropolitan area, covering the period from March 2020 to February 2021. The data used for this analysis was sourced from the COVID Tracking Project. The primary metrics of interest included monthly cases, cumulative monthly cases, monthly deaths, and cumulative monthly deaths. Initially, the data provided these metrics, along with others, on a daily basis for the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia. To ensure coherence and accuracy, multiple data cleaning procedures were implemented to merge the datasets and present the pertinent figures at a monthly level.

## Methodology
To efficiently clean and transform all the datasets into a merged dataset suitable for visualization, I utilized several packages from the tidyverse. Once the data preprocessing was complete, I created four data visualizations. First, a stacked bar chart was generated to depict the monthly COVID cases in the DMV region. Additionally, a line graph was produced to showcase the cumulative figures. As anticipated, the monthly COVID cases were lower in DC due to its smaller population, while Maryland and Virginia exhibited similar levels until the emergence of the Omicron variant in December 2020. Subsequently, a stacked bar chart was used to illustrate the monthly deaths in the DMV region, accompanied by a line graph depicting cumulative deaths. The trends observed in the comparison between states mirrored those observed in the cases analysis. Notably, Virginia experienced a significant surge in cases with the onset of the Omicron variant, which had a noticeable impact on COVID-related deaths. Lastly, I created a table displaying the average monthly cases and deaths in each area before and during the Omicron variant.  In summary, this analysis effectively examined various COVID-related metrics across the three regions, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the impact of COVID on the DMV area.
